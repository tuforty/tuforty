# Quota Threshold Exeeded

Hello {{ ucwords($user->name) }},

We would like to let you know that you've crossed the quota 
threshold of **{{ $user->quota_threshold }}%** placed on
your account. 

Your service with us will still continue operating as normal, 
pending when your current quota is exhausted.

Would you like to purchase extra quota?
