# Setting Quota Threshold

Quota threshold is a simple way for you to set when we should notify you, in cases were your  available quota is running out. This is useful in order to prevent unexpected interruption of service in a production environment.

We've come to identify that each team has different policies guiding how they renew subscriptions for services they rely upon.

A threshold can be within the range of **1%  - 100%**. Take for example the following scenario for a sample user:

* Purchases a plan with worth 5,000 quotas
* The users configures threshold to be 70%
* User will automatically receive an email once they remaining quota reaches 1,500.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Translation will still be possible even when the configured threshold has been reached and exceeded. It will only stop when the quota has been exceeded.
{% endhint %}
